    <!--Text section-->
     <p><h2> I am an English lit and civ major with an unconventional career path, from working with local environmental and political NGOs, to trying out the corporate world working in customer service, coordination and communication.<br>
      I discovered that I thrive best on my own terms, after successfully undergoing remote training and working with little to no supervision during most of 2020 as a freelance consultant with an international telecom company.<br> I have previous freelancing experience in content writing, translation, interpreting, transcription, subtitling and voiceover. 
      My exposure to tech started with extensive work in database cleaning, entry and visualisation with excel and google sheets as well as executing ready-made scripts in python.</h2>
